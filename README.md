# TL;DR

A simple Google Cloud Function _(Gen 2)_ that reads images from Google Cloud Storage and calls the Gemini API.

This project includes a yaml file for deployment to Google Cloud using Github Actions maintained here: https://github.com/google-github-actions/deploy-cloud-functions. The Github Action Workflow requires several _"Action Secrets"_ used to set environment variables during deployment. Set the following secrets in the repository before deployment.

| Action Secret | Value                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GCP_SA_KEY    | Service Account Key used to authenticate GitHub to GCP Project |
